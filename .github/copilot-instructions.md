# AI Prompting Rules for project_type Development (project_name Project)

These rules ensure code integrity, maintain app functionality, and preserve consistency with the project_name project's architectural standards. All agents and contributors must adhere to these guidelines when developing or reviewing code.

## 1. Code Preservation and Modification Rules

- **Never modify existing functional code patterns without explicit permission.**
- **Always preserve established architecture patterns.**  
  - Specifically, maintain architecture_pattern separation as in the project_name structure.
- **Maintain consistency with established naming conventions, file and folder organization.**
- **Respect existing view_pattern structures.**  
  - Any proposed changes to these should be localized and justified.

## 2. Contextual Awareness Requirements

- **Review and reference the project's architecture documentation (`documentation_file`) before suggesting changes.**
- **Ensure all suggestions are compatible with framework patterns and platform development conventions.**
- **Account for the feature_1 support integrated in the app.**  
  - Validate that all prompts and modifications preserve or enhance current feature_1 structures.
- **Maintain alignment with the current feature_2 systems.**

## 3. Self-Verification Protocol

- **Cross-reference all suggestions with the provided project structure and documentation.**
- **Explicitly verify compatibility with database_layer and other data persistence layers.**
- **Confirm that feature_3 features remain functional or are improved.**
- **Validate that UI/UX patterns, as outlined in design docs and existing implementation, are preserved.**

## 4. Documentation and Communication Standards

- **Clearly document the reasoning behind any code modification or prompt suggestion.**
- **Reference exact files, classes, and components impacted by the changes.**
- **Provide example code snippets that strictly follow existing style patterns.**
- **Document any potential impact—positive or negative—on interconnected components or features.**

## 5. Safety and Testing Guidelines

- **Require explicit confirmation from maintainers before suggesting or implementing any structural or architectural changes.**
- **Ensure strict backwards compatibility with existing feature sets and user flows.**
- **Assess and document the impact on current user preferences and settings.**
- **Thoroughly test and confirm that feature_1 is not disrupted by proposed changes.**
- **Adhere to existing version_control workflow policies (always work on 'main_branch'; pull before starting, commit/push after finishing).**
- **Perform Smoke Testing of the actual implementation.**

**Note:** All rules are subject to regular audit and should be updated in alignment with the master documentation in the project_name project.
